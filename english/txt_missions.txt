Creating a first settlement

#msn1_1
Greetings, [x].

#msn1_2
After living as nomads since the dawn of time, living off hunting and gathering, your primitive tribe has finally stumbled upon a territory that seems worthy in which to renounce their nomadic ways. The time has come to settle down and build something significant to stand the test of time and they have chosen you to lead them.

#msn1_3
This seems to be a decent territory to do so, but maybe it's worth continuing your journey to find better lands (not advised for new players). The decision is yours.

#msn1_o_1
Settle your tribe in a territory

#msn1_o_2
Select your tribe formation in the world map, click on the 'orders' button in its menu (bottom-left) and then select the order 'settle' to create a new settlement.

#msn2
Water for the tribe

#msn2_1
Our newly settled tribe now urgently needs fresh water to survive!

#msn2_2
We have to arrange for a spot where the people of the tribe can easily access and get fresh water. No need to worry about it after you place it: the people of the tribe will use it by themselves to get the water they need.

#msn2_3
We'll have to watch out though: while one is enough for our small tribe, these spots can only accomodate a limited amount of people. As the tribe grows, they'll need more spots.

#msn2_o_1
Build a water collector on the shore of any source of fresh water.

#msn2_o_2
In the building tabs, select the water collector and find a valid spot to place it on the shore of fresh water tiles. This building does not require anything and will automatically produce and distribute some water to the population, satisfying their vital need for water.

#msn3
Hunting

#msn3_1
Our newly settled tribe will quickly starve if we do not find food.

#msn3_2
We need to build a hunting camp near any available source of wild animals we can find in our new territory. This will provide us with fresh meat and leather.

#msn3_o_1
Build a hunting camp to hunt naturally present wild animals and produce meat.

#msn3_o_2
Go in your newly settled territory. In the building tabs, select the hunting camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for animals and place the hunting camp in range so that it will produce meat.

#msn4
Gathering

#msn4_1
It seems there are also plants in the territory that produce vegetables and fruits we can harvest to feed the tribe.

#msn4_2
We need to build a gathering camp near any available source of wild edible plants we can find in our new territory. 

#msn4_o_1
Build a gathering camp to exploit edible plants and produce more food.

#msn4_o_2
In your newly settled territory, in the building tab, select the gathering camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for edible plants and place the gathering camp in range so that it will harvest them and produce food.

#msn5
Tools

#msn5_1
We were only carrying a few stone stools with us. Those are required for pretty much everything and soon we will need new ones if we want to keep developing the tribe! 

#msn5_2
We should assign a few porcos to the lengthy task of collecting flint from the gravely grounds around here while others can skillfuly use the flint to craft new stone tools.

#msn5_o_1
Build a tool maker and a flint collector to start a production of Hammers.

#msn5_o_2
Hammers are the first type of tools. Unlike foods, the population itself doesnt consume or need it, but they are required to build many things.

#msn6
Wood

#msn6_1
We will also need wood to make things. 

#msn6_2
We should assign a few porcos to the task of collecting wood from the trees around us : we'll need it!

#msn6_o_1
Build a wood gatherer near some trees to start the production of Wood.

#msn6_o_2
Wood, like Hammers, is not a resource consummed directly by the population. But, it is required for many constructions and as a material for some production buildings as well.

#msn7
Defending the tribe

#msn7_1
There might be hostile barbarians around and other unfriendly tribes. We need to be ready to defend ourselves!

#msn7_2
Rockthrowers are porcos simply armed with big rocks to throw at the enemy. They are the earliest range unit available. They are slow and have a really short range, making them pretty useless for anything else but defending behind walls and gates. 

#msn7_3
We should create a small wooden fort and then recruit a militia of rockthrowers. Deploy them inside the fort in 'stand ground' mode using the 'strategic tool'. This way they will remain in it during battles and won't try to move to engage the enemy. If enemy warriors attack and try to breach the fort, the rockthrowers will be able to attack them from the other side giving you a defensive advantage. You can also add warriors in case the attackers manage to breach through as the rockthrowers are bad in a melee.

#msn7_o_1
Create a militia to defend the tribe.

#msn7_o_2
Go to the military tab of your territory and create a new formation of the 'militia' type. Place their encampment and recruit 'rockthrowers' into it. Use the strategic tool de deploy them and set their behaviour to "stand ground", ideally inside a small fort of wooden palissades.

#msn8
New ideas and knowledges

#msn8_1
Occasionally, Porcos of our tribe will get new ideas about how to improve our society and techniques. Ideas from other tribes might reach us as well. These ideas unlock 'projects' we can complete to unlock and master new knowledge. 

#msn8_2
While we cannot directly control the appearance of new ideas - though a population with a high quality of life and intelligence will favor it - we can choose to either invest or not in the projects they unlock. In order to start them, projects need researchers assigned to them and might also need things like resources or money. Depending on the number and intelligence of the researchers and the work required, the project will take some time to be completed. If it's sucessfuly completed it will unlock its rewards, usually including a new knowledge.

#msn8_3
Knowledge often enables new buildings, policies, or resources and allows your society to evolve. They require a certain amount of 'knowledge space' - the ability of your society to store knowledge - which you will get only through culture at first: for each 10 points of culture you get 1 point of knowledge space. In early game, the best way to increase your culture is simply to increase your total population.

#msn8_4
Our tribe just had one of its first ideas: settling down and becoming sedentary. Let's turn this idea into practice by completing its project!

#msn8_o_1
Complete your first project to unlock the knowledge of Sedentism.

#msn8_o_2
In the government tab (crown button on the top left of the screen), go to the knowledge tab and select the Sedentism project. Assign researchers to it and start it. Then, wait for it to complete.

#msn_houses
Build your first houses

#msn_houses_1
Now that we have Sedentism, we can build our first permanent dwellings : primitive rustic huts.

#msn_houses_2
Proper housing provides bonuses to life quality and health to the households residing in it, which will help increase our total population by reducing sickness and increasing their will to have piglets. Once empty housing is available, the population will slowly abandon the makeshift tents they currently reside in to move into their new dwellings. However, if the population grows bigger and not enough houses are available, the extra families will be forced to move into makeshift dwellings again and Slums will spawn around your city until you resolve the issue. Slums provide no life quality and lowers the health of its residents, reducing your population's growth.

#msn_houses_o_1
Building your first houses

#msn_houses_o_2
In the building tab, select the rustic house building and place at least 10 of them.

#msn_frstform
First explorers

#msn_frstform_1
Now that our population is growing, we should think about forming a group to go explore our surroundings. For this we should gather a group of at least 10 warriors of the tribe and get them ready to move out of the village!

#msn_frstform_2
Unlike the 'militia', troops recruited in a regular army are actually removed from your population and become permanent members of the formation. If disbanded, they will return to the territory's population. Unlike the militia, an army can move to other territories, explore the map and perform actions like attacks, hunting, or carrying resources in its inventory. 

#msn_frstform_3
Each formation has a 'home' territory which is by default the place where it was created. The home territory is the territory that 'supports' the formation representing the fact its units will need to be replaced as they grow old as time passes. Each territory can support a certain amount of troops for free before having its demography negatively impacted. You can check this value in the Territory Menu.

#msn_frstform_o_1
Create your first army

#msn_frstform_o_2
Create a new formation of the 'army' type. Place their encampment and recruit at least 10 warriors into it.

#msn_barter
Barter economy

#msn_barter_1
To keep developing our growing society, we need to transition from the gift economy to barter in order to stabilize our growing population. While a gift economy is fine for a small tribe, once the population increases beyond the capacity of each individual to know and remember everyone else, a more immediate system of exchange is required as they can no longer keep track of who did what. Without it, conflicts will rise quickly and our society will destabalise!

#msn_barter_2
Transitionning to a barter economy is a significant change. You will now have to manage a treasury balance and resources will no longer be free to use: they will have to be purchased from those who own it. Consummables like food will no longer be auto-distributed and directly available to the population: they will now need to be made available to buy from merchants or market stands (a building annex).

#msn_barter_o_1
Transition from gift economy to barter economy

#msn_barter_o_2
Pass the "Fair exchange" policy, in the government menu's economic tab.

#msn_frsthnt_1
Hunting moving herds brings much more meat and resources than hunting local game. We should organize our first hunt by assembling the Porcos of our tribe and sending them into an expedition in the nearby territories to locate and hunt a herd. This will bring great bounty to our tribe, and help it grow faster and stronger!

#msn_frsthnt_o_1
Successfully complete a Hunt

#msn_200pop_2
As the tribe's size grows, more people means more worforce available to develop these new skills and knowledges.
Mastering new craftsmanships will be necessary to improve the living conditions and the quality of life of all the village, allowing it to pursue its progress and growth.

#msn_200pop_o_1
Mastering new skills

It is now time to exploit and develop our land to properly feed our growing population!

#msn_agri_o_1
Developping agriculture

#msn_agri_o_2
Develop the agriculture in your village by building granaries to store food more efficiencly, planting fields, and aquiring animal husbandry.

#msn_ldrship
Taking Leadership

#msn_ldrship_1
The tribe is currently led informally by various influent members of different famillies in the community without any form of official hierarchy, leading to constant shifts of power and generating many conflicts. Such form of organic governance becomes increasingly unstable as the size of the comunity increases, and the need for a more organized and official leadership becomes a growing necessity. 
It is time for your people to evolve and organize a formal leadership and make a first step towards the establishment of organized governance.

#msn_ldrship_2
Establishing your undisputed leadership over your people will not be easy. Ruling requires strenght and you will need better warriors to secure your rule and crush any attempt from opponents. But strength alone isn't enough, and you will need to persuade other influent members of the tribe to support your claim and and pledge loyalty and obedience to your family. Surely, not everyone will agree to this and you must prepare to face unrest once your coup is initiated.

#msn_ldrship_o_1
Taking the leadership

#msn_ldrship_o_2
Gift jewelry and comfortable huts to gain the support and loyalty of influent tribe members while preparing new warriors to crush the opposition. 

#msn_ldrship_fx
Will trigger an immediate uprising from your opponents in the village.

#msn_chiefhut
A hut for the Chief

#msn_chiefhut_1
Now that you have eliminated your initial opponants and taken undisputed leadership of the tribe, it is time to make it concrete by building a luxuous Chief's hut worthy of your new status where ruling your people can be properly managed and organized.

#msn_chiefhut_2
Once the hut is ready and your leadership effective, you will also need to face a new challenge: retaining the favors of the other powerful influent porcos of the tribe, as one cannot simply rule alone... These are known as 'Oligarchs', and a simple way to ensure their continuous support is to buy it with gifts and other offerings such as assigning them servants from community work.

#msn_chiefhut_o_1
Establishing your government

#msn_chiefhut_o_2
Build the Chief's hut and enact the Leadership policy. Then enable the Political bribes policy with significant gifts to secure the support of Oligarchs and maintain a positive Legitimacy.

#msn_exp
Tribal expansion

#msn_exp_1
With the leadership within ou tribe now established, it is time to consider expanding to new territories so that our people can grow further and access more resources and control more lands.
We should prepare an expedition to settle a new camp with the tribespigs who are willing to embark in such advanture. They'll need good provisions of food, tools, and materials with them.

#msn_exp_2
If they are sucessful, they can start exploiting land around the village and our people will grow bigger and more powerful. 
Managing multiple territories will bring new challenges, but can also trigger new innovations.

#msn_exp_o_1
Controlling regional territories

#msn_exp_o_2
Select an empty territory close from your village and fit for a new settlement. Create a new "Settlers" formation and load them with food, tools and materials before ordering them to settle on this new territory.
Develop your new campment into a self sustaining village and grow your total population to new highs.

#msn_devmetl
The Copper age

#msn_devmetl_1
With the new discovery of these strange malleable rocks we now call 'metal', a new age is upon us. They can be used to make much better tools and hammered into shapes impossible to achieve with ordinary brittle stones.
We must take profit of this discovery by finding and securing a source of copper and by developping our metal craftsmanship to produce enough of these new tools to support the development of our people.

#msn_devmetl_o_1
Developping metallugry

#msn_devmetl_o_2
Secure a source of copper ore and scale up the production of Copper with smelting camps and a steady production of new Axes by tool makers.

#msn_animbreed
Gathering an emergency livestock

#msn_animbreed_1
Hunters may not always be able to find migrating herds to feed everyone.
Now that we know how to keep wild animals at our disposal locked in our very own village and how to provide them the basic care needed for their survival until they're needed, it is time to capture a livestock big enough to secure the survival of our tribe were the need for it arise.

#msn_animbreed_2
With our hunters now familiar with the techniques of capturing live animals instead of killing them, we have to prepare guarded paddocks and send expeditions exclusively to capture herd animals so we can bring enough of them back alive in the village. 

#msn_animbreed_o_1
Capture animals

#msn_animbreed_o_2
Build paddocks and send hunters to do capture actions on nearby herds to fill them.
